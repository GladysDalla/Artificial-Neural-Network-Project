# Artificial-Neural-Network-Project

In this assignment you build neural networks for regression and classification using Keras library.

Please start working on this assignment early to avoid last minute rush, it may take time to install things as well as to train neural networks.

Setup:

1. Go through A3.pptx slides and install the libraries. Try the code from the slides and make sure you understand it.

2. Choose one regression dataset and one classification data. You cannot use the datasets already used in A3.pptx slides. You can use the datasets from your previous assignments.

    Each dataset must have at least 1000 examples.
    Avoid a dataset with too many examples (e.g. millions) otherwise it will take too much computational time.
    Avoid a dataset with too many features compared to the number of examples otherwise the training will not go well.
    Do not use any image or text dataset.
    Handle any nominal features as in the previous assignment.

Assignment Tasks:

Task 1 (Regression): Build 4 different neural network models using Keras for the regression task. You can vary the number of hidden nodes, the number of hidden layers, the activation function, etc. Use only input and dense layers. For each model, plot the training errors and validation errors with the number of epochs. For any model, if the training error has not plateaued then increase the number of epochs. There will be 4 graphs, one for each model. In a Table also show the minimum validation error obtained by each model. 

Task 2 (Classification): Build 4 different neural network models using Keras for the classification task. You can vary the number of hidden nodes, the number of hidden layers, the activation function, etc. Use only input and dense layers. For each model, plot the training accuracy and validation accuracy with the number of epochs. For any model, if the training accuracy has not plateaued then increase the number of epochs. There will be 4 graphs, one for each model. In a Table also show the maximum validation accuracy obtained by each model.
